			<h1>Set.py and Running Python Inside a Browser</h1>
			<p>Sun 09 Aug 2020</p>
		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<p>A few weeks ago while in the process of making some homemade ravioli with some friends, I was introduced to a card game called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">Set</a>. After a couple of rounds (in which I performed abysmally), my friend suggested that we both try to make a program in Python that could play the game for us. After writing the program, I decided it was a fitting first post for this blog. However, as a result of deciding to post a Python program on a blog post, I decided to go down the rabbit hole of how I could interactively run the program on this web page. This turned out to be more complicated than I expected, and became the primary content of this blog post. Skip ahead to the <a href="#pythoninbrowser">second section</a> if that's all you're interested in.</p>
			<h2>Set.py</h2>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>Since the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/SET%20INSTRUCTIONS%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf">instructions for Set</a> explain the game far better than I ever could, I'm just going to boil it down to the part of Set that my program is capable of solving.</p>
			<p>The program is given a collection of N cards. Each of these cards has 4 features. The program must find and print any set present within the collection, with a set defined as 3 cards in which each of the cards' features, looked at one-by-one, are the same on each card, or are different on each card. You can check out Set's instructions (linked above), for examples of sets.</p>
			<h3>Input Specification</h3>
			<p>The first line of input takes in the positive integer N (the number of cards). The following N lines of input should contain the values of the 4 features for each card, separated by spaces (e.g. "oval red one solid"). Make sure to always enter the features in the same order (e.g. shape, colour, number, then shading).</p>
			<h3>The Program</h3>
			<div class="stay-skinny">
				<noscript style="color: red">JavaScript is disabled in your browser</noscript>
				<div class="card">
					<div class="text-left">
						<textarea id="setcode"></textarea>
						<div class="container">
							<button onclick="setrun()">Run</button>
							<button onclick="setclearout()">Clear</button>
							<button onclick="setreset()">Reset</button>
						</div>
						<pre id="setoutput"></pre>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>You can download the program by clicking <a href="set.py" download>here</a>.</p>
			<h3>How the Cards Are Stored</h3>
			<p>The program stores all the cards in a list called "cards". This is an example of what it could look like with 2 cards:</p>
			<code class="language-python">cards = [['oval', 'red', 'one', 'solid'], ['diamond', 'green', 'three', 'striped']]</code>
			<p>"cards" is a list of lists of strings. Each sublist represents a single card, with each string inside it describing the value of one feature.</p>
			<h3>Program "Constants"</h3>
			<p>The two all-uppercase variables at the top are intended to be constants (values that don't ever change during the program's execution). Python doesn't technically support these, so I had to make sure not to accidentally modify these in my code. "FEATURES" is the number of features that each card has and "SIZEOFSET" is the size of a set. The intention is that you could use this same program for a hypothetical game of Set where the number of features is not 4 and the size of a set is not 3.</p>
			<h3>Finding Matches</h3>
			<p>Matches are found with the find_match function. It takes in two parameters: "available", which is the list of cards left to be chosen, and "chosen", the list of cards that have already been chosen. When we first call it, we pass in the entirety of "cards" to "available" and an empty list to "chosen" (since nothing has been chosen yet). If there are not enough cards to make a set (by default 3, set by "SIZEOFSET"), it loops through every possible card that it could choose while leaving enough unchosen to make sure that "chosen" ends up with "SIZEOFSET" cards, and recursively calls itself. Ultimately, it's a recursive way of making enough nested for loops to end up with every possible combination of "SIZEOFSET" cards. The reason I couldn't just make it nested for loops was because the number of for loops I would need depends on "SIZEOFSET".</p>
			<p>When "chosen" has "SIZEOFSET" cards, we can start checking whether we have a set. There is a for loop that goes through each feature. Within it, we check whether the feature is unique or uniform throughout all the cards. If neither of these is true, then the for loop breaks. However, if the for loop finishes without ever breaking, that means that every feature in the set is either unique or uniform, and we print the set.</p>

			<h2 id="pythoninbrowser">Running Python Inside a Browser</h2>
			<h3>Some Context</h3>
			<p>Normally, a browser can only run two things: HTML + CSS and JavaScript (and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly">Wasm</a>, but that's still very new). HTML and CSS are not programming languages, so not much can be done with them (at least not in terms of running Python). JavaScript, on the other hand, is. However, JavaScript is still not Python, so how was I to run the code?</p>
			<h3>Considering My Options</h3>
			<p>Before deciding to make this blog post, I had already seen Python being run on a website before, and that was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://repl.it">Repl.it</a>. In fact, Repl.it supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/embed">embedding Repls</a>, which means that all I would have had to do is make an account, paste the code into a Python Repl, and stick the HTML embed code into my website. However, I didn't really want to do that since it would also mean that this blog post would break if Repl.it stopped working or got rid of their free tier. I also briefly looked into independently replicating what Repl.it does, but they use external servers and Docker containers to run code. While this is incredibly powerful, I completely lack the expertise to pull this off and even if I had the expertise it would have required me to spend more money on servers. At this point, I turned towards finding some way of running Python on the client-side. Why let servers run the Python if a browser could somehow do it as well? During my search for a solution, I stumbled across a couple of web apps that did precisely this, notably <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://trinket.io">trinket</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/CodeSkulptor">CodeSkulptor</a>. It turned out that both of them used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://skulpt.org">Skulpt</a> as their backend. In a sentence, Skulpt is an entirely in-browser implementation of Python that works by transpiling Python to JavaScript (thus allowing a browser to run it).</p>
			<p>I should also mention that after committing myself to Skulpt, I happened to stumble across a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58684358">Stack Overflow post</a> that listed a couple of other options. However, of the options listed that fit my needs (all the just-in-time compiled ones), Skulpt still seemed like the best option due to its relatively small download size.</p>
			<h3>Building Out the Solution</h3>
			<p>Jumping right into Skulpt, there is a pretty useful <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gist.github.com/bnmnetp/4650616">example on their site</a> which I made a copy of and placed below. Note that the version displayed below may be outdated if there were any updates made between the uploading of this blog post and the present. Also, if you want to see the HTML pasted below in action, click <a href="simpleskulpt.html">here</a>.</p>
			<div class="stay-skinny">
				<div class="card">
					<pre><code data-file="simpleskulpt.html" class="language-markup"></code></pre>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>I deleted the parts I didn't need (including the stuff about turtle since that's for graphics, and comments), modified the code to print errors on the webpage instead of to the console, and ended up with the code below. Click <a href="baseskulpt.html">here</a> to see it in action.</p>
			<div class="stay-skinny">
				<div class="card">
					<pre><code data-file="baseskulpt.html" class="language-markup"></code></pre>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>However, there are still two main things that I wanted to change: first of all, I wanted the part where the code was displayed and could be modified to have syntax highlighting. Second of all, my program for Set required input, and Skulpt's default configuration uses a pop-up window prompt to do this. It also doesn't display the prompt inside the input function (e.g. <code class="language-python">input("prompt")</code>) until after you have submitted the window prompt. My intention was not only to fix this, but also to modify the way Skulpt took input so that it closer emulated the way Python took input in the terminal.</p>
			<p>I started with the syntax highlighting. My initial idea was to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://prismjs.com">Prism</a>, which I happened to be using to highlight all the code in the code examples above and below this paragraph. However, it turned out that Prism only worked on code elements and while there was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://live.prismjs.com">work being done</a> to make it usable as a code editor (e.g. in a textarea element), it was still a "work in progress" at the time of writing. The next thing that I did was head over to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://skulpt.org">Skulpt website</a> to see how it was doing it. After a bit of digging around in the page source, I figured out that it was using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a> text editor. I also looked at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ace.c9.io">Ace</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor">Monaco</a>, but Monaco was way too heavy while Ace was much less so, but still heavier than CodeMirror (according to the page sizes of the examples shown <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://techslides.com/codemirror-versus-ace-editor">here</a>). Plus, by choosing CodeMirror I was able to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://skulpt.org/js/env/editor.js">a file from the Skulpt website</a> called editor.js as a template, pasted below.</p>
			<div class="stay-skinny">

			</div>
			<p>I also used parts of the Skulpt example above and the Basic Usage section of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html">a page from the CodeMirror website</a> to figure it all out. One unfortunate thing is that I was unable to find a working One Dark theme for CodeMirror, so I decided to just use Monokai. Maybe I'll try my hand at making my own CodeMirror theme at some point.</p>
			<p>On to the second issue: overwriting Skulpt's default input function. I stumbled across <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44434555">this Stack Overflow post</a> which not only showed an example of overwriting the input function, but also suggested appending a span element with the property contenteditable to the end of the output to take in input. Long story short, this would allow input and output to coexist in the same place, like they do when you run a Python program normally in the terminal. Unfortunately, due to a series of weird bugs in Chrome/Chromium (but not Firefox!), I was forced to use input elements instead, although I still ended up with the intended effect. This whole part really just boiled down to writing a function I called <code class="language-javascript">myinputfun()</code> and including it in the Skulpt configuration, as well as setting inputfunTakesPrompt to true to let my input function handle prompts (e.g. <code class="language-python">input("prompt")</code>).</p>
			<p>This is the final version of the code that I used:</p>
			<div class="stay-skinny">
				<div class="card">
					<pre><code data-file="editor.js" class="language-javascript"></code></pre>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>And that's it! Three different open source projects (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="prismjs.com">Prism</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://skulpt.org">Skulpt</a>), and many hours later, I finally finished this site's first blog post. Thanks for reading!</p>
